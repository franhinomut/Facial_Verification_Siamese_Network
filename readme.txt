In this project, I have learnt how to build a deep facial recognition application to authenticate into an application. 
I have started off by building a model using Deep Learning with Tensorflow, which replicates what is shown in the paper titled "Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition" (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf)
